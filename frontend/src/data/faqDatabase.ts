    question: "What are Newton's Laws of Motion?",
    answer: "**Newton's Three Laws of Motion:**\n\n**1st Law (Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.\n\n**2nd Law (F = ma):** Force equals mass times acceleration. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass.\n\n**3rd Law (Action-Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n📝 **Board Tip:** Always draw free body diagrams and resolve forces along axes for numerical problems.",
